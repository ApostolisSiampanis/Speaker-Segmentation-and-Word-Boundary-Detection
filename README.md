# Speech and Audio Processing (2024) - Speaker Segmentation and Word Boundary Detection

## Project Overview

This project was completed as an individual assignment for the "Speech and Audio Processing" course in the 8th semester of the 2024 academic year at the University of Piraeus, Department of Informatics. It involves the development of a Python-based program designed to segment speech recordings into individual words and classify them as either background or foreground sounds using machine learning techniques. The system processes audio input and detects word boundaries without any prior information about the number of words present in the recording.
